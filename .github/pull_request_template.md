When creating a pull request to add a new feature or alter an existing one,
there are some important elements to include to help our team review and process it more efficiently.

1. Make sure the title is descriptive of what the PR includes. Don't mention issue names/numbers; save that for the description.

2. List the names of those who contributed to the project.

3. Link the issue the pull request is meant to fix/resolve.

4. Add all labels that apply. (e.g. documentation, ready-for-review)

5. Describe the contents and goal of the pull request.

6. Will coverge be maintained/increased?

7. What operating systems has this been tested on? How were these tests conducted?

8. Include a code block and/or screenshots displaying the functionality of your feature, if applicable/possible.

Mark as a draft until it is ready to begin the reviewing process, then tag our Lead Software Architect,
[Jeff Normile](https://github.com/jnormile), our Founding Engineer, [Gregory Kapfhammer](https://github.com/gkapfham),
and our Project Managers, [Haylee Pierce](https://github.com/hayleepierce) and [Sabrina Rodriguez](https://github.com/rodriguez03)
when you mark it as ready for review.
